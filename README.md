This repository contains the training data and code used in the study published as "Machine learning-based investigation of optimal synthesis parameters for epitaxially-grown III-nitride semiconductors".

All training data sets are saved as comma-separated value (CSV) files with identifying names in the "Data" folder.

Every code script can be found organized in the "Code" folder.

The R scripts used for importance analysis and algorithm design are saved in the "R" folder within "Code".

The Python script copies are organized into folders identifying the training data set that they are written to be used for.

Included are the Python scripts used for generating the test data sets as well as the programs for training the random forest algorithms on the experimental data before making predictions using the previously generated test data.
